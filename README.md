Evolving EdgeMaps
========

My extension to the EdgeMaps visualization tool created by Marian Doerk, with the link to Marian Doerk's original work available [here](http://mariandoerk.de/edgemaps/). I added a time evolution functionality for the musicians dataset, allowing users of this visualization tool to observe the evolving influence of a given musician over a set timeframe.
